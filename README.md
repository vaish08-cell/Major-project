📌 Project Title:
Drone-Based Evapotranspiration (ET) Sensing System for Agricultural Water Management

🎯 Objective
This project aims to develop an intelligent, drone-assisted system to accurately estimate Actual Evapotranspiration (AET) in agricultural fields. By integrating sensor data and AI/ML analysis, the system helps optimize water usage, improve irrigation efficiency, and promote sustainable farming practices.

🔧 Key Components
Drones:
Equipped with high-resolution thermal and multispectral cameras to gather detailed crop and canopy data.

Environmental Sensors:
Include GPS, pressure, temperature, and humidity sensors to monitor local microclimatic conditions.

AI/ML Algorithms:
Analyze drone and sensor data to estimate AET and predict water needs using advanced models.

Cloud Integration:
Enables real-time data upload, storage, and processing for remote access and analytics.

User Interface:
Mobile and web-based dashboards provide farmers with actionable irrigation recommendations and insights.

⚙️ Working Principle
Drones fly over agricultural fields, capturing thermal, spectral, and environmental data.

AI/ML models process this data to calculate Actual Evapotranspiration.

The system determines optimal irrigation timing and quantity, helping reduce water waste.

Recommendations are delivered to the farmer via a user-friendly interface.

🚧 Challenges Faced
Maintaining sensor accuracy across diverse and dynamic field conditions.

Seamlessly integrating real-time data processing with drone flight operations.

Designing scalable and cost-effective solutions accessible to farmers with varying resources.

🏆 Achievements
Successfully tested a functional prototype in controlled environments.

Received positive evaluations from agricultural experts regarding system potential and scalability.

Deployed AI models achieving over X% accuracy in predicting water requirements (insert confirmed metric if available).

🔮 Future Scope
Integrate IoT devices for automated, real-time irrigation based on ET data.

Improve AI accuracy with larger, more diverse training datasets.

Collaborate with agricultural institutions and government agencies for broader field trials and deployment.
